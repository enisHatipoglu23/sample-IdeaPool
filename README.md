#### near call $CONTRACT addIdea '{"head":"ideaPool", "intro":"lorem ipsum", "idea":"awesome idea"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.testnet
#### near call $CONTRACT isHeadUsedBefore '{"headq":"ideaPool"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.testnet //returns true because ideaPool is used before.
#### near call $CONTRACT rateTheIdea '{"headq":"ideaPool", "vote":"like"}' --accountId YOUR_ACCOUNT_ID.testnet
