## Setting up your terminal

The scripts in this folder are designed to help you demonstrate the behavior of the contract(s) in this project.

It uses the following setup:

```sh
# set your terminal up to have 2 windows, A and B like this:
┌─────────────────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────────┐
│                                 │                                 │
│                                 │                                 │
│                A                │                B                │
│                                 │                                 │
│                                 │                                 │
└─────────────────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────────┘
```
